# Project Description

We are faced with the task of classification. We have data on the behavior of customers who have already switched to these tariffs (from the draft course "Statistical Data Analysis"). You need to build a model for the classification problem that will select the appropriate rate. Data preprocessing is not required. Let's build a model with the highest possible value of accuracy

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a classification model that predicts which tariff plan a customer of the "Megaline" mobile operator will choose based on their behavior. We will analyze customer behavior data, including the number of calls, call duration, number of SMS messages, and internet traffic usage.

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries were utilized for this project:

- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `joblib`

## Instructions for Running

1. Ensure that you have all the required libraries installed.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the project file.
